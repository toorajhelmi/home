[Handling imbalanced datasets in machine learning](https://towardsdatascience.com/handling-imbalanced-datasets-in-machine-learning-7a0e84220f28)

- Imbalanced data is an issue if classes are not separable
- For inseperable data, imbalanced data can be fixed using under/over sampling or adding extra-features
- When there is imbalanced data it is very important took look at metrics beyond accuracy like F1 score, confusion matrix, ...
- Nice mathematical treatment of this concepts similar to what I had seen similar in estimation theory
