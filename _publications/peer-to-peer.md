excerpt: 'This study investigates a novel streaming architecture consisting of home-to-home online (H2O) devices that collaborate to provide on-demand access to a large selection of audio and video clips. An H2O device consists of a high bandwidth wireless communication component, a powerful processor, and gigabytes of storage. This study investigates three families of replication strategies for a H2O cloud. We evaluate these using analytical models. The obtained results demonstrate the superiority of one strategy that determines the number of replicas for a clip i based on (a) the bandwidth required to display clip i> proportional to the bandwidth required by the other clips in the database, and (b) the square root of the frequency of access to the clips.'
