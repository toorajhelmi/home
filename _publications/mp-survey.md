title: "A Survey on Machine Programming Techniques"
collection: machine-programming
permalink: /publication/mp-survey
excerpt: In this survey we review and classify the research on machine programming. We are specifically interested in the research that takes a description of code and generates software. We introduce a taxonomy with 5 dimensions and use it to classify the existing research. For each class, we look at the dominantly used approaches and go over several examples of using them in machine programming.'
