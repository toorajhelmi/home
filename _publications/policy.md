excerpt: 'Ad hoc networks of wireless devices such as Car-to_cat Peer-to-Peer Networks (C2P2) are an emerging technology. Entertainment applications that manipulate continuous media, audio and video clips. push the limits of these networks due to their stringent requirements. These challenges are magnified by environmental characteristics such as dynamic wireless network connections, mobility, multi-hop nature of network connections, mobility, multi-hop  nature of the network and the possible lack of fixed infrastructure. In these networks, an intelligent admission control policy enhances Quality of Service (QoS) observed by the users of the system. This paper makes the case for a decentralized Mobility based ADmission Control (MADC) policy. We develop QoS utility models to quantify the performance of the policy with an environment that employs no admission control. Obtained results show conclusively that MADC provides orders of magnitude improvement when compare with no admission control.'
