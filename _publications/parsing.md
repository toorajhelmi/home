title: "Parsing Natural-Language based Software Requirements into Code Segments"
collection: machine-programming
permalink: /publication/parsing
excerpt: 'In order to transform software requirements into code, we first need to identify and refine the existing ambiguities. In this paper, we introduce a systematic approach towards detecting ambiguities that depends on two key elements: a grammar that specifies the unambiguous syntax, and second, an NLP model to map software requirements to its terminal symbols.'
