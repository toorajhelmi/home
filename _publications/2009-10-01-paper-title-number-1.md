title: "Near Optimal Number of Replicas for Continuous Media in Ad-hoc Networks of Wireless Devices."
collection: multimedia
permalink: /publication/near_optimal
excerpt: 'This study investigates replication of data in a novel streaming architecture consisting of ad-hoc networks of wireless devices. One application of these devices is home-to-home (H2O) entertainment systems where a device collaborates with others to provide each household with on-demand access to a large selection of audio and video clips. These devices are configured with a substantial amount of storage and may cache several clips for future use. A contribution of this study is a technique to compute the number of replicas for a clip based on the square-root of the product of bandwidth required to display clips.'
