Interchain could be the future of cloud computing. Like how Uber and Airbnb let people rent their car and home, Interchain let people rent their computers and get paid based on the amount of resources consumed from them including storage, CPU, and bandwidth. Applications that will run on the computer range from web servers to distributed simulations. 

Everybody with a PC, Mac, or Linux can join Interchain by installing the Interchain Node application. 

Interchain uses advance computing concepts including blockchain and containerized applications to distribute and monetize cloud computing. See the [this documents](http://toorajhelmi.github.io/home/files/interchain.pdf) to learn more.

I have built two distributed applications on top of interchain:

1. [A Distributed Messaging App](https://player.vimeo.com/video/243564228)
2. [Distributed K-Nearest Clustering on a Large Dataset](https://player.vimeo.com/video/244788052)
