Cloudezine simplifies how cloud-native applications are built by introducing a very high level, cloud agnostic language called CADL (Cloud Architecture Design Language). Our platform called CloudForm takes the code written in CADL and deploys it to all major clouds (Azure, AWS, and GCP). Our designer called Clouder provides a drag-and-drop designer allowing architects and developers to design and deploy native-cloud apps directly from a graphical design studio. See a [demo here](https://player.vimeo.com/video/327990659)

Cloudezine is composed of four components:

1. CADL: A fully cloud-agnostic language working seamlessly on all clouds. CADL reduces the code required for building infrastructure and logic by 50 folds.

2. CLOUDER: A drag-and-drop visual designer allowing architects to focus on their design rather than writing code. Clouder generates CADL and optionally Terraform scripts under the hood.  

3. CLOUDFORM: The code should be written once and be deployed seamlessly to all clouds. Cloudform deploys CADL to AWS, Azure, and GCP without requiring any change to CADL code or requiring to provide cloud-specific configuration.

4. CLOUDSTORE: A marketplace for cloud architects to publish their cloud architecture with verified specifications to sell them to the public.

5. CLOUDBRAIN: Just talk with Cloudbrain and explain your system. It will take care of the rest and build the system in a matter of minutes.
